# 2025-03-04 - Backups
## ðŸŒŸ Summary
- [x] Enabled `scheduled backups` for the Heroku database of Nervenex app.

## ðŸ”¨ Work Done
- [x] Used the command `heroku pg:backups:schedule DATABASE_URL --at '03:00 Africa/Lagos' --app=nervenex`. This will make heroku to automatically create backups for the database everyday at 3:00AM Africa/Lagos time.
- [x] Logged in as user 'Ebube' and took a quiz. This changed the state of the database by addding a new record in attempts table and more in answers table.
	* Used the command `heroku pg:backups:restore a003 DATABASE_URL --app=nervenex` to restore the database to its previous state before taking the quiz. Where `a003` is the ID of the particular backup that was restored. It was a success.
	* On refresh of the web site, the user **Ebube** ` does not have a quiz history for the test he just took; the new record in the table `attempts` was deleted as well as all the new records in the table `answers`.
	* All other changes that occured in the database before the backup were not affected. This shows that the backup is functional and restoration is easy. Took few seconds.

## ðŸ›  Challenges & Solutions
1. **Backup Restoration:**
	* Once created a MySQL dump of the nervenex database.
	* Converted it to a Postgre dump using an online converter.
	* On attempt to upload it to Heroku, it was declined and the existing Heroku database was wiped clean
**Solution:**
	* Discovered and enabled `scheduled backups` on the heroku database
	* Started afresh to populate the app. Created three new users, created five new quizzes and made three attempts at the quizzes.

## ðŸš€ Next Steps
- [ ] Move the header, menu and footer from individual html templates to the master Jinja template. In attempt to reduce redundancy and foster easy maintenance.
