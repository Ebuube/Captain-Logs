# 2025-03-04 - Backups
## ðŸŒŸ Summary
- [x] Enabled `scheduled backups` for the Heroku database of Nervenex app.

## ðŸ”¨ Work Done
- [x] Used the command `heroku pg:backups:schedule DATABASE_URL --at '03:00 Africa/Lagos' --app=nervenex`. This will make heroku to automatically create backups for the database everyday at 3:00AM Africa/Lagos time.

## ðŸ›  Challenges & Solutions
1. **Backup Restoration:**
	* Once created a mysql dump of the nervenex database.
	* Converted it to a Postgre dump using an online converter.
	* On attempt to upload it to Heroku, it was declined and the existing Heroku database was wiped clean
**Solution:**
	* Discovered and enabled `scheduled backups` on the heroku database
	* Started afresh to populate the app. Created three new users, created five new quizzes and made about five attempts at the quizzes.

## ðŸš€ Next Steps
- [ ] Move the header, menu and footer from individual html templates to the master Jinja template. In attempt to reduce redundancy and foster easy maintenance.
