# 2025-03-15 - Color Coding and Login button
## ðŸŒŸ Summary
- [x] Modified `/correction` and `/signup` page.

## ðŸ”¨ Work Done
- [x] Added color-coding for `/correction` page to show correct, wrong and unanswered question numbers.
- [x] Added login button on `/signup` page to allow users easily switch from signing up to logging in.
- [x] Automatically deployed the `web_dynamic` branch after merging the changes.

## ðŸ›  Challenges & Solutions
1. **`Login` instead of `Log in`:**
    * `Login` button was put on the page, which is not consistent with the practice of split-words used on that page.
  - **Solution:**
    * Changed `Login` to `Log in` and merged changes to `web_dynamic` branch.
   
## ðŸš€ Next Steps
- [ ] Revise the Login mechanism of Nervenex to have expiry, enforce password strength policies, and prevent storage of sensitive details on local storage (browser).
