## ðŸ›  Challenges & Solutions
1. **Nesting of `style` and `script` blocks**:
  * This is not allowed in Jinja templates.
  - **Solution:**
    * Deleted `head` block from `base.html`.
    * moved common tags such as `meta`, `title` etc. to the `head` tag of `base.html`.
    * Created two new Jinja blocks `styles` and `scripts` for their respective purposes.
2. **`quiz_history` mal-rendering:**
	* Every quiz item in `quiz_history` page lost its animation on hover.
