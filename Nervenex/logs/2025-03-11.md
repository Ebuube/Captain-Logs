## ðŸ›  Challenges & Solutions
1. **`quiz_history` mal-rendering:**
    * Every quiz item in `quiz_history` page lost its animation on hover.
  - **Solution:**
    *  Discovered that `quiz_history.html` still uses the non-existent `head` block from `base.html`.
    * This block contains the page-specific CSS stylesheets for `quiz_history` endpoint.
    * This means that the page lost its styling such as *Animation on hover*.
    * *Replaced* the `head` block with `styles` block to recover the styles.

## ðŸš€ Next Steps
- [ ] Split Nervenex into two microservices. One runs the API and the other manages the dynamic web page generation.
